      "description": "Your company is trying to develop the ultimate AI - even including speech recognition for pets. To run such computationally intensive tasks, your team must enhance and support the infrastructure it uses to train all these models. These intense computations need lots of resources to run, but computers suitable for machine learning are very expensive! You must optimize space, memory, etc. to get the most out of the machines you've got. Infrastructure should be flawless and you don't want to cost your owners more money or be a bottleneck for the researchers.",
